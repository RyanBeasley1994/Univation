To start the app cd in to frontend and run "npm start"

Before trying out the application you also need to server the backend 
cd in the backend and run "node server.js"

i have attached the .env file so you have the access to the database i set up for the application 
this database will expire in 2 days.
if you require a couple extra days of access please contact me at: Ryanbeasley1994@gmail.com
